I took a course on Linear Algebra in Fall 2024, and I found the Gram-Schmidt Process interesting.
I also took a course that focused on Functional Programming during the same semester.
So naturally I combined those two things together to create this project!
It was all done within 3-4 hours on December 31st, 2024.
I hope you find this project interesting!
